####### Giphy Mctastic ########
# Synopsis; Using the giphy API I have created a web app that allows you to search and diplay GIPHY's
1. The user is able to dynamically add buttons to the page using a form input
2. when the user clicks a button an API call is made returning 10 GIPHYS from a query based on the buttons name
3. each GIPHY has a button that allows you to add it to a personal Favorites list
4. Favorites are stored in a local storage database so the user can refresh the page and keep favorites
5. User can remove favorite GIFs dynamically

### Languages ###
Web app makes use of HTML/CSS, and Javascript/Jquery. Ajax calls to API server provide the data requested
